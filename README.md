# Intent-Centric Computing Whitepapers

This repository contains research whitepapers focused on intent-centric computing and its applications in modern software development.

## Contents

1. **A Framework for Intent-Centric Computation**
   - A comprehensive framework that explores how intent-driven approaches can revolutionize computational systems
   - Discusses the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of intent-centric computing

2. **Intention is All You Need**
   - An exploration of how intention-based systems can simplify and enhance software development
   - Draws parallels with attention mechanisms while focusing on the power of intentional computing

## Purpose

These whitepapers aim to advance the understanding and implementation of intent-centric computing paradigms. The research presented here explores how we can move beyond traditional programming approaches to create more intuitive, efficient, and powerful computational systems that better align with human intentions.
